<b>Technology</b> is the result of <i>accumulated knowledge and application of skills, methods, and processes
used in industrial production and scientific research</i>. Technology is embedded in the operation of
all machines, with or without detailed knowledge of their function, for the intended purpose of an
organization. The technologies of society consist of what is known as systems. Systems operate by 
obtaining an input, altering this input through what is known as a process, and then producing an
outcome that achieves the intended purpose of the system.
<br>
The earliest and simplest form of technology is the development of knowledge that leads to the
application of basic tools. The prehistoric invention of shaped stone tools and the discovery
of how to control fire increased the sources of food that were available to human beings. The
invention of the wheel led to the travelling technologies that helped humans to further increase
the yield of food production, travel in less time, and exchange information and raw materials faster.
Humanity then progressed to the development of the printing press, the telephone, the computer, 
and then the Internet.
